Node.js

1.A platform which allows us to run javascript on a computer/server
2.Read,delete and update files
3.Easily Communicate with Database

Why is Node.js so popular?

1.It Uses Javascript
2.Very Fast(runs on the V8 engine and uses non blocking code)
3.Huge ecosystem of open source packages(npm)
4.Great for real-time services(like chats)

*V8 Engine:- It's the thing that takes our JavaScript code and executes it while browsing with Chrome.
*Non blocking code:- It refers to the program that does not block the execution of further operations. 
                     Non-Blocking methods are executed asynchronously. 
                     Asynchronously means that the program may not necessarily execute line by line. 
                     The program calls the function and move to the next operation and does not wait for it to return.
